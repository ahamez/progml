This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for all the chapters in "Programming Machine Learning". If you like to run and edit code in a Notebook, then you can use the code in this directory instead of the *.py files in the regular chapters' directories.

These Notebooks are made to be read together with the book. They barely contain any text, except for titles that match the book's sections. Also, they lack most of the code that generates the charts in the book, as that code would make the Notebooks very long and confusing. You can find the plotting code in the regular chapter directories.

Enjoy,
