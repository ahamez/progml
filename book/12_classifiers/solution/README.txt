You'll find three images in this directory.

data.jpg shows the circles.txt dataset. See? I told it wasn't linear. ;)

perceptron_boundary.jpg shows the boundary of a perceptron trained on this dataset. Being straight, this boundary cannot partition the data points in a meaningful way. Both partitions contain a mix of blue and green points.

neural_network_boundary.jpg shows the boundary of a neural network, and neural_network_model.jpg shows the model of the same network in 3D. Now we're really talking!
