Here is my solution to the Minesweeper challenge. To run it, download sonar.all_data from the official site, and put it in this directory. Then run sonar_classifier.py.

This classifier reaches over 79% accuracy on the test set. That's not half bad if you consider that, according to the Sonar dataset's documentation, human experts rank between 88% and 97%.
